Octopus
=======

Channel-based messaging for Erlang.

Yeah, crazy. And?

Progress
--------

- So far only an interface. (half-baked)
- Then going to implement stuff

Plan
----

The plan is to write an otp-based framework for communicating via channels.

I might introduce spec-based typing, but who knows.

Then, some syntax for it! I have no idea what, but something!
